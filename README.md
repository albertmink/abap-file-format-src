# abap-file-format-src
This repository contains the ABAP types behind ABAP file formats, no documentation.

The format of the interfaces itself is ABAP file format (JSON-based) and not the legacy abapGit format (XML-based).
So, for pulling the files with abapGit, you might enable the Experimental Features.
