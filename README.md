# ABAP-file-format-src
This repository contains the ABAP sources behind the [ABAP file formats](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats).

You can pull the repository via abapGit.
You might enabled the experimental features, since the ABAP sources itself are provided as ABAP file format (JSON-based) and not the legacy abapGit format (XML-based).
